# Terminology server
This is a terminology server prepackaged with the currently published Belgian terminologies.

The docker image contains all that is needed for deployment, except the SNOMED cache files.

More information is available [from the HL7 Europe documentation](https://hl7-eu.github.io/tx.hl7europe.eu/) as well as from the [HL7 Confluence page on running the server](https://confluence.hl7.org/spaces/FHIR/pages/79503408/Running+your+own+copy+of+tx.fhir.org).
